### What did you learn?
* HTML: Table, tr, td tags
* JavaScript: Using a Class & constructor
* Git: Version control of a project start to finish

## Optimizations
My initial commit was a Minimum-Viable-Project, I used many functions to display information on the page. 
Using a class allowed me to clump many of those functions into a method.
There are a lot of properties that this object returns and I can expand the project to have more information available.
